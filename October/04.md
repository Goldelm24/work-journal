### Building APIs

Today it's a continuation of what we learned yesterday about routing and navigation. We'll go over API endpoint, Route handlers, data validation and much more.

To build APIs all we have to do is add a route file (route.tsx) in a directory. It is important to know that in Nextjs we can either have a page or a route file but not both within the same directory for example: `api/users/route.tsx`

Now lets talk about getting a single object. Below is an example of how it's done.
```
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function GET(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: { id: number } }
) {
    if (params.id > 10) 
        return NextResponse.json({ error: 'User not found'}, { status: 404})

    return NextResponse.json({ id: 1, name: 'Josias'})
}
```
If the id is less than 10 we'll get a 404 error otherwise it'll return the `name: Josias` and the `id` of `1`. In the browser you can check by `http://localhost:3000/api/users/11` which gives you `User not found` error.
