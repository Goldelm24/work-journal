### Database Integration 
We'll be learning more about what we went over yesterday and utilize `Prisma`, is an open-source Node.js and Typescript ORM. It acts as a sort of middleware between our application and the database helping us to manage and work with our database.

In the terminal we run `npm i prisma` after that we should install `MySQL` from the browser and remember the `"root"` password to use later when running prisma. Below is a `schema.prisma` file that's inside a `prisma folder`. This is automatically created once install.
```
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```
Next inside the `.env`file we..
```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:(******)@localhost:3306/nextapp"
```
The root is the password created from the MySQL that we install on our computer.

### Models
Data models represent the entities of our application domain.
```
model User {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String  @unique
  name      String
  followers Int     @default(0)
  isActive  Boolean @default(true)
}
```
